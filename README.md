# Walmart_Verity

This project was built for the Walmart Hackathon 2020. We proposed the idea of kiraya storage management during the period of Covid to reduce stress on warehouses of Walmart. Soon after this, the same idea was implemented by Flipkart!!
We built an website for these stores to register themselves, and connect with Walmart. Further details of this work have been documented in [Slides](Walmart Hackathon Presentation.pdf) and [Docs](Walmart Hackathon.pdf)!
